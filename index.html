The Friendly Facade</strong>\nI asked dad and guddu and I came to your door,\nYou steeled yourself strong like never before\nA hug so polite, words careful and light\n"We are good friends," u said, hiding love from his sight.</span>\n\n<span style="color: #8B7355;"><strong>4. West Side Shadows</strong>\nWe met where the crowds would not know who we were,\nBut sunglasses stayed as you were still not sure\n"What if they see us and tell dad ?" you would say,\nHis daughter, they would whisper, and give us away.</span>\n\n<span style="color: #A0522D;"><strong>5.

Kala Jamun I got</strong>\nYour favorite fruit Jamun in a bag that I brought,\nYou took it, then gave it back, lost in thought\n"Where did this come from?

In my Grief - Darkest Hour</strong>\nWhen my dad departed and my sorrow ran deep,\nYou wanted to comfort but promises to keep\n"I told dad," you said, "he will let you know when,"\nEven in loss, you were scared of his approval again.</span>\n\n<span style="color: #DAA520;"><strong>8. Toni & guy meeting</strong>\nThrough Toni and Guy, we found our escape,\nHours of hair care gave love bond its shape\nIn mirrors reflecting what could not be said,\nBeautiful moments while fears were all shed.</span>\n\n<span style="color: #B8860B;"><strong>Your first few days in India:</strong>\n<em>Eight moments of longing, of love held at bay,</em>\n<em>Not scared of our hearts, but what he might say</em>\n<em>In every stolen glance, in each whispered word,</em>\n<em>A love that was felt but never quite heard.</em>\n\n#committed4life #willwait4u #myBB</span>',
